# 🔐 Custom Encoder

A simple yet flexible command-line encoder written in Python. It uses a binary lookup table to encode and decode data. Supports both default base64-style encoding and user-supplied custom keys.


## 🚀 Features

    Encode and decode using a predefined binary lookup table

    Accept custom keys for user-defined encoding schemes

    Simple command-line interface (CLI)

    Easy to extend or embed in other Python projects


## 🧠 How It Works

The encoder reads a binary file containing a lookup table that maps bytes to custom symbols or representations. This allows for secure or specialized encoding and decoding operations, useful in applications like:

    Data obfuscation

    Custom data transmission formats

    Educational tools for cryptography concepts
