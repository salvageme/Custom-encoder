# Welcome to Custom encoder

First of all, thank you for downloading this software.


# Some key point for using this encoder:-

1. This program uses a 64 character key. This key is used to do both encoding as well as decoding. DO NOT LOSE THIS KEY!!!

2. By default the program acts as a Base64 encoder/decoder. The default key given in the folder can be used to encode base64 anytime.

3. You must create a unique key for custom encoding. This key must:
	+ Be 64 characters long.
	* All characters must be unique (it is case sensitive).


# How to use? :-

1. Run the main.py script.
2. Choose one of the options to 
	* Encode
	* Decode
	* Enter custom key


# IMPORTANT

* If you are using a custom key, you should hide it properly. If anyone else finds this key they can easily use the decoder to read all your sensitive data.

* I recommend that after you are done with using the program, you enter the default key in before leaving. This will make sure that no one can use this
    program to decode to data without the key.
    
* If you want someone else to use this program, maybe your partner or friend or someone, just ask them them to get the program from Github and then hand them
    a copy of the key. And if are really serious about the privacy, give them the key in person.

* If you suspect that an unauthorized person has somehow acquired the key, change the key immediately and re-encode your data. Make sure you first decode the
    data, otherwise it will be lost or get corrupted.
    

Enjoy!!!
